Write a JAVA program using an appropriate data structure that will be used to arrange order of customer’s application for the new or renewal of passports based on priority. If the customer paid urgent passport application or renewal fee of 150 Euros, the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs will give a high priority. Second, if a person wants to travel abroad due to some medical reasons, the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs will provide a high priority. Third, if the children are requested for new passport or renewal to travel with their family, the department is allocated a second level of priority, while the remaining applicants are considered as normal. You would need to develop an application that should address the above-mentioned scenario using an appropriate data structure. The Data structure should store the records based on priority, application number and name of applicant. It further provides the facility of removal of applicant’s name from the storage and display the list of applicants to the authorities based on their priority.
